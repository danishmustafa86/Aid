## What is AidLinkAI?

AidLinkAI is an intelligent emergency response system that helps people get the right help quickly during emergencies. Think of it as a smart assistant that connects you to the right emergency services and guides you through the process.

## How It Works

- **Police Emergency**: Crimes, theft, violence, suspicious activities  
- **Electricity Emergency**: Power outages, electrical hazards, utility issues

### 2. **Specialized Assistance** 👥
Based on your emergency type, you're connected to a specialized AI assistant:
