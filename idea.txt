Problem:
Frontline workers (triage nurses, emergency officers, council staff, social services, crime responders) and
citizens both struggle with long queues, unclear protocols, and slow case handling. Citizens often don’t
know where to go, while staff face overwhelming workloads.
Challenge:
Build a multi-agent AI system that bridges citizens and frontline workers by:
- Triage Agent (Frontline): Analyzes case data (type of emergency, citizen requests) and decides
urgency.
- Guidance Agent (Frontline): Matches case to the right service (hospital department, emergency
team, any other service).
- Booking Agent (Citizen-facing): Autonomously books appointments, pre-fills forms, or drafts
emails/SMS to the right office.
- Follow-up Agent (Citizen-facing): Sends reminders, tracks service progress, and explains updates in
plain language.
- Equity Oversight Agent: Tracks service demand vs. capacity and generates insights for
administrators.
Dataset: Mock emergency requests by the citizens, list of hospitals, wards etc.
Deliverables:
- Working demo of emergency service agent
- The AI agents collaborate to assess the case → find the right service → autonomously book an
appointment/fill the form → provide a plain-language confirmation (e.g., “Appointment booked at XYZ
clinic tomorrow at 9am. Bring your ID card.”).
- Must include a degraded mode for offline, low-bandwidth, or low-cost usage.
